# Graduation-Thesis-Project-Management-System

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a team-developed graduation project management system designed to digitalize the entire workflow — from topic registration to final evaluation.  
The platform supports role-based access for students, lecturers, and academic staff, allowing efficient communication and tracking throughout the project lifecycle.

It was developed by a team of 4 members over 3 months using **C# ASP.NET MVC** and **vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript**.  
As the **team leader**, I was responsible for coordinating development and implementing the frontend interface.

- 👥 Team size: 4 members (2 Frontend, 2 Backend)  
- 👨‍💼 Role: Team Leader + Frontend Developer  
- ⏱️ Duration: 3 months (from planning to deployment)
